Once upon a time there was a Community House (also known as the Village House), and the surrounding slopes all point towards Village House, so the name Village House Slope was formed from there. ",
      "According to some elderly people living here, originally, the area bordering Ham Nghi (Truong Cong Dinh street) and Cau Queo (Phan Dinh Phung street) was called Doc Nha Lang, because in the location of An Hoa communal house today there is the headquarters of the main Huong Council (Village House), the hall is an area for village heads and members to discuss village affairs and adjudicate a number of cases occurring in land matters and residential area rules. ",
      "There are also some people who believe that at the beginning of the alley near Ham Nghi Street, there is a small wooden house for Huong Chuc's work. But over time this old house deteriorated and according to the new planning, the location of the new Village House was located near An Hoa communal house as it is today.Since 1953, Doc Nha Lang was renamed Nguyen Bieu Street, but the surrounding residents and tourists are still familiar with the old name of Nha Lang."

Dalat assembles emotions that dissolve, overturn, and overlap. Dalat is seen from within to reality and from the outside to itself. Dalat is black, reminiscences are white. Dalat is distant, but nostalgia is close. Dalat is a place one wants to stay or return to, yet it exists but seems unreal”.” “Dalat, city on hill” in Thế Thông's paintings carries a message of conserving the old architectural features, architecture merging with nature, and preserving and protecting the urban environment, preserving the green landscape of a city with beautiful and poetic scenes."

The exhibited pieces encompass a diverse range of materials and styles, spanning from oil paintings, ink sketches, to watercolors.",
      `In the compilation titled "Tiny Dalat", curated by the students from the University of Architecture Ho Chi Minh City (Dalat Campus), a series of drawings capture the endearing essence of Dalat's architectural spaces. These students, who hold a deep affection for Dalat, have preserved these cherished locations through isometric projections, technical drawings ranging from elevations to plans, and from exteriors to interiors.`,
      `The selected artworks showcased in the Là Việt Coffee spaces exude a vibrant, dynamic, and profoundly inspirational atmosphere. Speaking about the idea behind organizing this mobile art exhibition, Mr. Nguyễn Trung Hiền, a representative from the event organizers, emphasized the intention of spreading art to a wider community, allowing diverse audiences to appreciate both art and engage in conversations within an open space, as opposed to the confines of conventional art rooms or studios.`
